        <h2>VisualVM View Wizard: Name and Location</h2>
        <p>
            The VisualVM View wizard creates a new VisualVM View
            for a selected VisualVM data source.
            You open the New VisualVM View wizard by right-clicking a
            module project, choosing New > Other and selecting VisualVM View
            from the Module Development category.
        </p>
        <p>In the Name and Location page, you have to set the following:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Prefix.</b> Specifies the prefix for the new
                VisualVM classes that will be generated by the wizard. This
                value also sets the text in the view's tab.
                <li><b>Data Source.</b> Specifies the data source for which
                you are creating the view:
                <ul>
                    <li>Application
                    <li>CoreDump
                    <li>DataSource
                    <li>HeapDump
                    <li>Host
                    <li>SnapShot
                    <li>ThreadDump
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note:</b> If you select "DataSource", you will create a new
                view that will be shown for <i>all</i> data sources. Selecting any
                of the others will create a new view only for the specific data source
                that you selected.
                <li><b>Package Name.</b> Specifies the name of the package where the
                generated classes will be created.
            </ul>
            <hr>
        </p>
    </body>

<!--
Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
<param name="content" value="https://www.netbeans.org/">
<param name="text" value="<html><u>https://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
<param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
<param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
