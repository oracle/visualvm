OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Profiling
OpenIDE-Module-Name=Java Profiler (JFluid)
ProfilerClient_CannotOpenServerTempFileMsg=Cannot open temporary communication file created at the server side.\nName\: {0}
ProfilerClient_PerformingInstrumentationString=Performing instrumentation, please wait...
ProfilerClient_InvalidCodeRegionMsg=Invalid location was specified for code region instrumentation.\nInstrumentation cannot be performed.
ProfilerClient_ClassNotFoundMsg=Could not find class {0} on the class path.\nInstrumentation cannot be performed.
ProfilerClient_OutOfMemoryMsg=Too much data collected - the profiler ran out of memory.\nCollected profiling data has been deleted and profiling resumed.\nTo avoid this error in future, increase the -Xmx value\n in the etc/netbeans.conf file in NetBeans installation\nor lower the amount of details in profiling settings.
ProfilerClient_IncorrectAgentVersionMsg=Warning\: The profiler agent you are connecting to is a different version than this profiler.\nYou may encounter errors and unexpected behavior.
ProfilerClient_ErrorGettingCalibrationDataMsg=Error when retrieving saved calibration data for target JVM\:\n{0}
ProfilerClient_MustCalibrateFirstMsg=Since you did not run the Profiler on this machine or target JVM before,\ndeleted the saved calibration data, or this data is corrupt, profiling will STOP now.\n\nYou have to run the calibration command for your target JVM\nbefore running the Profiler with it again.\nThe obtained calibration data will be saved and re-used\non subsequent runs, so you will not see this message anymore.\n\nTo perform calibration, make sure the Java platform used for profiling is\nregistered in your IDE and invoke the \"Run Profiler Calibration\" command.\n\n
# HTML-formatted
ProfilerClient_MustCalibrateFirstShortMsg=<html><b>Calibration data missing.</b><br><br>Profiling cannot be started on this JDK. Please perform<br>profiler calibration first and start profiling again.</html>
# HTML-formatted
ProfilerClient_InstrumentationLimitReachedMsg=<html><b>The limit of 64K instrumented methods has been reached.</b><br><br>The profiler cannot instrument more methods, some of your code<br>will not be profiled.<br><br>To avoid this problem, limit the number of profiled classes by<br>changing the profiling roots and/or instrumentation filter.</html>
ProfilerClient_CorruptedTargetCalibrationDataMsg=Problem with saved calibration data on target machine\:\n{0}
ProfilerClient_ConnectVmMsg=Connecting to the target VM...

TargetAppRunner_CalibrationSummaryShortMsg=The calibration was successful.\nClick Show Details to see calibration results.\n\nWarning\: If your computer uses dynamic CPU frequency switching,\nplease disable it and rerun calibration as changing the CPU frequency\nduring profiling would produce inaccurate results.

TargetAppRunner_CalibrationErrorMsg=Data transfer error during instrumentation calibration
TargetAppRunner_InternalStatisticsOnlyMsg=This is internal statistics that should be used only to estimate the efficiency\nof CPU profiling implementation. It is not for end-user results measurements.\n\n
