<h2>Heap Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Heap window is typically located in the main editor window of the IDE and displays 
detailed information about the heap when the heap snapshot was saved.</p>
<p>You open the heap snapshot in the Heap window by choosing Profile &gt; Load Heap Dump from the main menu.</p>
<!--
<p>The toolbar of the Threads window contains the following items:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <th scope="col">Button</th>
        <th scope="col">Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
    <td><img src="img/saveView.png"></td><td><b>Save Current View.</b>Click this to save an image of the current results as a <tt>.png</tt> file.</td></tr>                        
    <td><img src="img/zoomIn.png"></td><td><b>Zoom In.</b>Click this to increase the detail of the graph.</td></tr>                        
    <td><img src="img/zoomOut.png"></td><td><b>Zoom Out.</b> Click this to decreases the detail of the graph.</td></tr>
    <td><img src="img/scaleToFit.png"></td><td><b>Scale-to-Fit.</b> Click this to modify the display of data so that the entire graph fits in the window.</td></tr>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The toolbar also contains a dropdown list that enables you to filter the display according to the state of the thread.</p>

<p>The Threads window contains the following two tabs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Threads (Timeline).</b> This tab displays thread states over time. 
            You can zoom in/out on the current view, or switch to the Scale to Fit mode. States can be displayed
            for all threads, all live threads or all finished threads according to the combobox selection. You can also
            define a subset of threads to be displayed using a (multi)selection. Double-clicking a thread
            displays the details of that thread in the Threads (Details) tab.</li>
            <li><b>Threads (Details).</b> This tab displays more detailed information about 
            individual threads. Use the dropdown list in the Threads tab toolbar to select which threads 
            to display. The name, classname and current status (alive/finished) of each thread is 
            displayed. A short description of the thread is also provided. 
            The tab contains the following two tabs:
            <ul>
                <li><b>General.</b> This tab displays a pie graph illustrating thread state statistics.</li>
                <li><b>Details.</b> This tab contains a full listing of the thread's states,
                with timestamps. A timeline for each thread provides a quick 
                overview of that thread's activity while it is being monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
