        <h2>Analyze Performance: Basic Options</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When analyzing application performance, you can configure basic and advanced options for the profiling session.
        The following basic options are available for analyzing object lifecycle.
        If you are configuring a custom configuration, click Advanced Settings to specify <a href="csh_cpu_options_adv.html">advanced options</a>.</p>
        
        <p>When analyzing application performance, you specify one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Entire Application.</b> 
            When selected, all of the methods of the profiled application are instrumented. 
            <p>When entering a method, threads generate a "method entry" event. 
            Threads generate a corresponding "method exit" event when exiting the method. 
            The timestamps for both of these events are recorded. 
            This data is processed in real time.</p></li>
            <li><b>Part of Application.</b> 
            When selected, a limited part of the application's code is instrumented.
            The part that is instrumented is determined by the defined root methods.
            Profiling data is not collected until one of the application's threads enters the root method. 
            This option can greatly reduce the profiling overhead.
            <p>To use this option, you need to specify a root method using the popup menu in the source code
            or by clicking define to open the Specify Root Method dialog box.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, you can set the following options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Filter.</b> You can use a filter to limit the classes that are profiled and control the overhead. 
        The following default filters are available.
        <ul>
            <li>Profile all classes</li>
            <li>Profile only project classes</li>
            <li>Profile project &amp; subprojects classes</li>
            <li>Quick filter</li>
            <li>Exclude Java Core Classes.</li>
        </ul>
        If you select Profile Only Project Classes or Profile Project &amp; Subprojects Classes
        you can click Show Filter Value to see the the classes that will be profiled.
        If you select Quick Filter, you can click Edit Filter Value to see and modify the filter criteria.
        You can create your own filter by clicking Edit Filter Sets.</li>
        
        <li><b>Use Defined Profiling Points.</b> When selected, any actions that are initiated by enabled profiling points 
            in the project are performed. Disabled profiling points are ignored. When deselected, all profiling points in the project
            are ignored.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Overhead bar graph provides you with a rough indication of the overhead that will
        be incurred when you profile the application with the current settings.</p>
