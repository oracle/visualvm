        <h2>Analyze Performance: Basic Options</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When analyzing application performance, you can configure basic and advanced options for the profiling session.
        The following basic options are available for analyzing object lifecycle.
        If you are configuring a custom configuration, click Advanced Settings to specify <a href="csh_cpu_options_adv.html">advanced options</a>.</p>
        
        <p>When analyzing application performance, you specify one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>Sample Application.</b> 
            When selected, the IDE samples the application and takes a stack trace periodically.
            This option is less precise than instrumenting methods, but the overhead is lower.
            This option can help you locate methods that you might want to instrument.
            </li>
            <li><b>Profile Application.</b> 
            When selected, all of the methods of the profiled application are instrumented. 
            <p>When entering a method, threads generate a "method entry" event. 
            Threads generate a corresponding "method exit" event when exiting the method. 
            The timestamps for both of these events are recorded. 
            This data is processed in real time.</p>
            <p>You can choose to limit the part of the application's code that is instrumented
            by defining root methods. 
            This option can greatly reduce the profiling overhead.
            You can specify a root method using the popup menu in the source code
            or by clicking <strong>customize</strong> to open the Edit Profiling Roots dialog box.
            When you specify a root method,
            profiling data is not collected until one of the application's threads enters the root method. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, you can set the following options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Filter.</b> You can use a filter to limit the classes that are profiled and control the overhead. 
        The following default filters are available.
        <ul>
            <li>Profile all classes</li>
            <li>Profile only project classes</li>
            <li>Profile project &amp; subprojects classes</li>
            <li>Quick filter</li>
            <li>Exclude Java Core Classes.</li>
        </ul>
        If you select Profile Only Project Classes or Profile Project &amp; Subprojects Classes
        you can click Show Filter Value to see the the classes that will be profiled.
        If you select Quick Filter, you can click Edit Filter Value to see and modify the filter criteria.
        You can create your own filter by clicking Edit Filter Sets.</li>
        
        <li><b>Use Defined Profiling Points.</b> When selected, any actions that are initiated by enabled profiling points 
            in the project are performed. Disabled profiling points are ignored. When deselected, all profiling points in the project
            are ignored.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Overhead bar graph provides you with a rough indication of the overhead that will
        be incurred when you profile the application with the current settings.</p>
