        <h2>Customize Filter Sets Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When profiling an application, you use the Customize Filter Sets dialog box to customize existing filter sets and to create new custom filter sets.
        You use a filter set to limit the classes that are instrumented when analyzing application performance.</p>
        
        <p>You can access this window by clicking Edit Filter Sets in the CPU Analysis configuration pane in the Select Profiling Task dialog box.</p> 
        <p>The dialog box has the following sections:</p>
        
        <h3>Defined Filter Sets.</h3>
        <p>This section displays the filter sets that are available when profiling an application.
        You can use the buttons to the right of the list to add and remove filter sets and to change the order 
        that the filter sets are displayed in the Filter drop-down list in the configuration pane.</p>
        
        <p>When you select a filter set in the list, the set name, type and global filters included in the filter set are  
        displayed in the Filter Set Properties section. A filter set can include more than one global filter.</p>
        
        <h3>Filter Set Properties.</h3>
            <p>This section displays the properties of the selected filter set. 
        Filter sets have the following properties:</p>
        
        <p><b>Filter Set Name.</b>
        This is the name used to identify the filter set in the Filter drop-down list in the configuration pane.</p>
        
        <p><b>Filter Set Type.</b>
        The filter set can be one of the following two types.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Exclusive.</b> When selected, classes meeting the criteria of the selected filters are excluded and not instrumented.
            Profiling results for these classes do not appear in the collected results.</li>       
            <li><b>Inclusive.</b> When selected, only the classes meeting the criteria of the selected filters are included in the instrumentation.
            Profiling results are collected only for these classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Global Filters.</b> Each global filter in the list represents groups of patterns that are typically 
        related to one application. For example, <tt>org.netbeans</tt> is a pattern.
        A filter can contain more than one pattern. Patterns can be separated by a comma and/or space.</p>
        <p>When you create a filter set, you select the global filters that you want to exclude or include.
        To modify or create global filters, click Edit Global Filters.</p>
