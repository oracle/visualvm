<h2>Telemetry Overview Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Telemetry Overview window displays smaller versions of the graphs that are presented in the
VM Telemetry window. The window displays high-level data on thread activity and 
memory heap and garbage collection in the VM. 
The VM Telemetry window is typically located below the editing area and sharing the space with the
Output window</p>
        
<p>You open the Telemetry Overview window by choosing Window &gt; Profiling &gt; Telemetry Overview from the main menu.</p>

<p>The VM Telemetry tab contains three graphs displaying data on the following processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Threads (Statistics).</b> The Threads graph displays the total 
            number of threads in the profiled application JVM. You can place your cursor over the 
            graph to display a tooltip with the current and maximum number of threads.</li>                    
            <li><b>Memory (Heap).</b> The Memory (Heap) graph displays the total and used size. 
            These are the figures that a Java application can obtain using the <tt>java.lang.Runtime.totalMemory()</tt> and 
            <tt>java.lang.Runtime.freeMemory()</tt> calls.</li>
            <li><b>Memory (GC).</b> The Memory (GC) graph displays the relative time spent in 
            garbage collection and the number of surviving generations.</li>
        </ul>
        
<!--        <ul>
            <li><b>Relative time.</b> Relative time is measured as a percentage of the total execution time that 
            the target JVM spends running garbage collection with all application threads 
            suspended.</li>
            <li><b>Surviving generations.</b> Displays the number of different 
            ages for all objects allocated on the JVM heap since the moment the Profiler was 
            attached.</li>
            <li><b>Age of object.</b> The age of the object is measured as the number of 
            garbage collections survived.</li>
        </ul>
